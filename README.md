# Simple WPF Role Playing Game;

  This is a simple RPG for practice with WPF and C#/XAML in order to get more familiar with how the code works, how things should be laid out in a given project, and how to make sure code is usable, clean, and testable. I followed a tutorial for most of this project. That tutorial can be found at: https://scottlilly.com/build-a-cwpf-rpg/
